  <h1>ARPPrimeAmp</h1>
  <p>ARPPrimeAmp is a physics‑inspired composite filter that combines curvature‑adjusted π with an ARP amplifier to score integers. For each candidate divisor a phase defect is computed and exponentiated; the ARP amplifier integrates this resonance score over time to produce a signal \(G_n(t)\). High scores indicate composite numbers, while low scores mark prime candidates. Quickstart scripts demonstrate classifying numbers and include options for GPU/vectorized kernels and hybrid workflows.</p>
