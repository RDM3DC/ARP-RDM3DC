  <h1>Adaptive Dynamics Toolkit</h1>
  <p>The Adaptive Dynamics Toolkit is a unified framework that brings together adaptive π geometry, ARP optimization, physics simulations and compression algorithms. It installs easily via pip and includes examples showing how to compute curved geometry with the Adaptive π class, train neural networks with an ARP optimizer and visualize the results. Comprehensive documentation provides getting‑started guides, API references and tutorials, and a pro version extends the toolkit with CUDA acceleration and advanced features.</p>
