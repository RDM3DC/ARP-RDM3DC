  <h1>Adaptive π Demo Game</h1>
  <p>The Adaptive π Demo Game is a curve‑native shooter prototype inspired by classic arcade shooters. Built on a lightweight kernel inspired by Adaptive π and AdaptiveCAD, it uses parametric geometry and non‑Euclidean rendering instead of triangle meshes. Players control their ship with the keyboard and shoot with the spacebar. The game includes a simple engine with curve primitives, entities and collision detection written in Python, and a roadmap suggests replacing primitive samplers with πₐ‑native curve objects and adding GPU‑backed rendering in future versions.</p>
