  <h1>Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP)</h1>
  <p>The Adaptive Resistance Principle describes adaptive conductance that updates in response to a driving current. Its core equation \(\frac{dG}{dt} = \alpha |I(t)| - \mu G(t)\) models reinforcement and decay rates. Closed‑form solutions and transfer‑function interpretations show that ARP acts as an exponential low‑pass tracker of the absolute current. This repository hosts various Python scripts exploring ARP behaviour, including double‑slit experiments, dynamic resistance simulations and preliminary travelling‑salesperson solvers.</p>
