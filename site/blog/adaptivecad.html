  <h1>AdaptiveCAD</h1>
  <p>AdaptiveCAD is a next‑generation modeling toolkit built on adaptive π geometry. It provides node‑free smooth curves, hyperbolic geometry tools, fast STL repair and smoothing, and 3D‑print export. The toolkit includes a playground application with parametric editors (such as superellipse and πₐ splines) and a live viewport. It also offers libraries of advanced shapes and hyperbolic curves and a repair pipeline for messy meshes. Outputs can be exported as STL/3MF or G‑code, and integrations are available for FreeCAD and Blender.</p>
