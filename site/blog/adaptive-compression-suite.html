  <h1>Adaptive Compression Suite</h1>
  <p>The Adaptive Compression Suite provides three complementary compression methods. ATC (adaptive text compression) strips visible spaces, punctuation and case and encodes them as style bytes alongside a compact carrier string. CMC (curve‑memory compression) encodes anchors at curvature or turning events and reconstructs signals with an ARP‑style smoother. GPUC (GPU/Tensor compression) applies quantization and zero‑suppression to numeric arrays, with an optional CUDA path via PyTorch. Command‑line tools and Python APIs demonstrate encoding and decoding for each method.</p>
