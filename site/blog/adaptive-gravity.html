  <h1>Adaptive Gravity â€” Galaxy Rotation Simulation</h1>
  <p>Adaptive Gravity applies the Adaptive Resistance Principle to gravitational strength in galactic rotation curves. Gravity evolves according to \(\dot{G}(r,t) = \alpha \rho(r)^2 - \mu G(r,t)\) and enforces a pivot radius where all rotation curves cross. The model uses realistic Milky Way components such as a Hernquist bulge and an exponential disk and outputs rotation curves, acceleration profiles and CSV tables for further analysis.</p>
