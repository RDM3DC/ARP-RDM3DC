  <h1>Adaptive π Geometry</h1>
  <p>Adaptive π geometry is a lightweight Python library and reference specification that unifies Euclidean and curved geometry. It provides testable primitives that reduce to classical Euclidean results when curvature approaches zero and expose curvature corrections otherwise. The repository contains modules for angle sums, cyclicity, flux integrals and advanced constructions such as Ceva, Menelaus and Miquel points, along with examples and tests demonstrating the framework.</p>
