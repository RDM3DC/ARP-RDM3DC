  <h1>Adaptive Golden Field</h1>
  <p>Adaptive Golden Field makes the golden ratio dynamic. The recurrence \(F_n = F_{n−1} + r(x,t) F_{n−2}\) leads to a generalized ratio \(ϕ_a(x,t) = (1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 r(x,t)})/2\). Coupling the adaptive parameter r to a gravity‑like potential and tracing rays in an optical metric reveals caustics that surge, precess and ring. The repository includes scripts to simulate inspiral, precession and ringdown phases and to produce cinematic animations.</p>
