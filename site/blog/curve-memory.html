  <h1>Curve Memory (CMA)</h1>
  <p>Curve Memory encodes curves as memory and memory as curves, sitting at the intersection of adaptive π geometry and the Adaptive Resistance Principle. Updates released in September 2025 integrate adaptive π with dynamic curvature and damping terms, introduce a minimal glyph alphabet parameterized by curvature and torsion and explore wedge‑product compressibility. The repository provides examples and Python implementations for encoding and decoding curve memories and discusses 2D/3D formulations using Frenet–Serret equations and rigid‑motion‑invariant curve descriptors.</p>
