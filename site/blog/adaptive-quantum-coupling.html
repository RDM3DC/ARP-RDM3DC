  <h1>Adaptive Quantum Coupling — Bell Chip</h1>
  <p>This project studies quantum systems coupled to an Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP) memory field in a “Bell chip” platform. It derives coupled equations in which the system’s state and a memory field evolve together. The framework enables tunable coherence, wavefunction steering, history‑dependent phase shifts and controllable decoherence. Closed‑form limits reveal how fast or slow memory regimes affect dynamics, and the repository includes scripts to reproduce key runs and plots.</p>
