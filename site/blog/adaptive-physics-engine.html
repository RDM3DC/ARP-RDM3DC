  <h1>Adaptive Physics Engine</h1>
  <p>This real‑time physics engine models a charged‑particle beam steered by the Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP) and adaptive π geometry. It includes a multi‑zone 3D simulator with modules for the injector, ARP electromagnetic chamber, resonance lens, adaptive π coil and target detector. A reinforcement feedback loop tunes the ARP parameters to minimize beam spread, and an interactive dashboard exposes sliders for field parameters and live visualization. The repository also contains schematics, CAD sketches and hardware notes for a bench‑top prototype.</p>
