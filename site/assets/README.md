# Adaptive π assets

Drop campaign media in this folder:

- `hero.mp4` – hero teaser video used above the fold. (Ignored by git so you can keep big files local.)
- `hero_poster.jpg` – optional poster frame if you prefer not to use the built-in gradient placeholder.
- `logos/` – marks and lockups.
- `screenshots/` – renders, product shots, or gameplay teasers.

- `.gitignore` keeps large binaries (`hero.mp4`, `hero_poster.jpg`) out of version control by default. Remove entries if you intentionally want to commit the media.

> Tip: keep filenames lowercase with dashes/underscores so links stay clean.
